# restore the node_modules:
npm install

# run application:
npm start

# (In Web Browser):

# create SQL database:
localhost:3000/createdb

# create SQL tables ( which should create 4 tables ):
localhost:3000/createTables

# then go to the main page and go to the "Join us today" tab and "sign in":
# Check the box to create at least 1 doctors account for the application:
localhost:3000/

# then go to the main page and go to the "Join us today" tab and "sign in" to create new standard account
localhost:3000/

# Now you should be able to run the application smoothly:
# And login as a doctor or patient and see the correct schedules
